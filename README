NAME
    Algorithm::Interval2Prefix - Generate prefixes from intervals

SYNOPSIS
      use Algorithm::Interval2Prefix;
      my @prefixes = interval2prefix('33400','33599');

      print join(',', @prefixes); # prints "334,335"

DESCRIPTION
    Taking an interval as input, this module will construct the smallest set
    of prefixes, such that all numbers in the interval will match exactly
    one of the prefixes, and no prefix will match a number not in the
    interval.

    E.g. all numbers in the interval 39967000 to 39980999 would be matched
    by the following set of prefixes:

      39967
      39968
      39969
      3997
      39980

    This type of conversion is particularly useful when working with
    telephony switching equipment, which usually determines call routing
    based on number prefixes rather than ranges.

    The algorithm is much dependent on the number base, which defaults to
    10. Other number bases can be specified explicitly.

FUNCTIONS
  "interval2prefix()"
      my @p = interval2prefix($lo, $hi);
       or
      my @q = interval2prefix($lo, $hi, $base);

    Yields an array of prefixes, covering the interval $lo to $hi, using
    number base $base.

    $base is optional, and defaults to 10.

EXPORT
    &interval2prefix is exported by default.
