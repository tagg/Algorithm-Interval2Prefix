Taking an interval as input, this module will construct the smallest
set of prefixes, such that all numbers in the interval will match
exactly one of the prefixes, and no prefix will match a number not
in the interval.

This type of conversion is particularly useful when working with
telephony switching equipment, which usually determines call routing
based on number prefixes rather than ranges.

See the POD for further documentation.
